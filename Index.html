        <p class="little">Akan names are derived from Ghanian culture. </p>
        <p class="litte">The Akan are a meta-ethnicity living primarily in the countries of present day Ghana and Ivory Coast</p>
        <p class="little">Frequently in Ghana, children are given their first name as a 'day name' which corresponds to the day in the week they were born.</p>
        <p class="little">The well thought and organized naming system of the Akan's was initiated by the ancestors and has attracted so many people's attention as they desire to know more about these names.</p>
        <p class="little">These names have further meanings concerning the character of a person</p>
        <p>These are the Akan names</p>
